A vibrant pre-colonial Aztec village viewed as if through a memory or flashback, with slightly dreamlike quality. The scene shows multiple stepped pyramid structures in the background, with colorful murals visible on their sides. In the foreground, a bustling marketplace with vendors selling pottery, textiles, and produce. Ceremonial spaces with stone altars and bright flower decorations are visible. Traditional Aztec homes with thatched roofs and adobe walls line the background. People in various traditional Aztec clothing go about daily activities - warriors training, artisans working, children playing. The scene has rich, saturated colors with particular emphasis on turquoise, red ochre, and gold tones. The lighting suggests late afternoon with warm golden sunlight casting long shadows. Hyperrealistic photography style with high attention to historical accuracy in architecture, clothing, and activities. Wide panoramic view capturing the full scene with excellent depth of field showing both close details and distant structures. A subtle vignette effect or soft edges reinforces the flashback/memory aesthetic.
