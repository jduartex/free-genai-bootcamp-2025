The hidden tunnel is narrow and shadowed, a forgotten passage carved deep into the stone beneath the prison cell. Its walls, rough and jagged, are slick with moisture, the dampness seeping through the ancient stone like the remnants of a lost time. The air is cool and stale, heavy with the scent of earth and decay, yet there’s a faint, almost imperceptible breeze that moves through the tunnel, hinting at the outside world beyond.

The entrance, barely visible against the wall, is concealed by a loose stone that blends seamlessly into the surrounding surface, as if it were never meant to be found. Once shifted, the stone reveals a narrow gap just wide enough for a person to slip through, the rough edges scraping against skin as one squeezes inside. The tunnel’s low ceiling forces the body to bend uncomfortably, but its dark, winding path is a lifeline, promising escape from the grim confines of the prison.

The stone beneathfoot is uneven, with jagged protrusions and slick patches that threaten to trip up an unwary traveler. The tunnel twists in sharp, tight turns, the path narrowing further in some places, making it almost impossible to move without scraping against the walls. Faint traces of old, forgotten markings—Aztec symbols etched deep into the rock—adorn certain spots along the walls, their meanings lost to time but offering a glimpse into a past that predates the Spanish invasion.

As the tunnel stretches on, the air grows heavier, the silence more profound. The only sounds are the soft shuffle of feet against the stone and the occasional drip of water from the tunnel’s ceiling. The dim light from the outside grows fainter with each step taken deeper into the passage, until it’s swallowed completely by the oppressive darkness ahead. The tunnel feels like a secret—an ancient, hidden way carved out of necessity, offering both the promise of escape and the uncertainty of what lies at its end.
