A dimly lit 16th century Spanish colonial prison cell in Mesoamerica. Dark stone walls with moisture seeping through in places, with some carved Aztec symbols hidden in corners. A small barred window high on one wall lets in shafts of golden sunlight, creating dramatic shadows. The cell contains a wooden plank bed with thin straw mattress, a simple wooden table with a clay water jug, and a single stool. Various objects that can be examined are scattered around: a loose stone in the wall, scratches that form a pattern, a discarded piece of Spanish armor, and a dropped quill pen. A heavy wooden door with iron reinforcements and a complex lock mechanism dominates one wall. The atmosphere is tense but with elements of hope shown in the light beams. Hyperrealistic photography style with high attention to historical detail and texture. The scene should be shot with dramatic cinematic lighting with strong contrast between light and shadow areas. Wide angle to show the full environment in a single establishing shot.
