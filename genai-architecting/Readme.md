## Business Requirements:

## Main Goal 
Maintain 300 active students with high support and responsiveness.

## Expansion Goal
Increase the number of active students to at least 400 by the end of the year.

## Infrastructure Requirements:
To meet this goal, the system must be able to scale seamlessly as the student base grows.

## Scalability
The infrastructure should support scaling with minimal downtime. This could be achieved through elastic scaling solutions that automatically adjust based on demand.

## Support and Responsiveness: 
The system needs to handle increasing interactions (queries, student data, etc.) and should provide tools for student support (e.g., chat support, automated responses, etc.). This ensures high-quality customer service even with increased users.

## Functional Requirements:

### Capability:
Auto-scaling Infrastructure: The system should dynamically scale the resources (CPU, memory, storage, etc.) based on the number of active users.

How it works:
Automatic Scaling: The system will monitor usage in real-time and adjust resources when needed. For instance, if the student count increases, the platform can automatically allocate additional resources (servers, databases) to ensure smooth operation.

Cloud Services: A cloud-based solution (e.g., AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud) could be ideal since they offer on-demand scaling and load balancing features that automatically adjust based on usage.

Load Balancing: Distribute the load evenly across multiple servers to prevent any single server from becoming overwhelmed, ensuring that the system remains responsive even during peak hours.

## Assumptions:

### Open-source LLM (Large Language Models):
We are assuming that the Open-source LLMs selected will be sufficient to run effectively with an initial investment of $10k-$15k in hardware.

## Considerations:

### Hardware Suitability: 
Ensure that the hardware chosen supports the computational requirements for running LLMs. LLMs are resource-heavy, especially during training or when processing large amounts of data. A good investment in GPUs, high-performance CPUs, and substantial RAM will be essential.

### Open-source Models: 
Since you're assuming the LLMs will be open-source, it’s important to validate the chosen model’s capabilities. Some open-source LLMs may be more efficient or require less computational power. Popular models include:
GPT-Neo, GPT-J: Open-source alternatives to OpenAI’s GPT models.

BLOOM: Another large open-source model.

### Training Data: 
Ensure that the LLMs are pre-trained or fine-tuned on appropriate datasets to avoid copyright and content restrictions.

## Data Strategy:

### Concerns on Copyrighted Materials:
Since there are concerns about using copyrighted materials, it is important to ensure that all content used in the system is legally compliant.

### Purchasing and Storing Materials: 
Materials that are used for training or are part of the database need to be properly licensed.

### Purchasing Content: 
Obtain materials from legal sources, ensuring the right licensing to avoid violations. Platforms like Creative Commons or Public Domain materials could be used, or licensing agreements can be made with content providers.
### Storage and Access: 
Content will need to be stored securely, ensuring access control measures are in place to avoid unauthorized use.

### Traceability: 
The use of the IBM Granite model, which emphasizes transparent and traceable training data, will aid in ensuring there are no copyright issues. You’ll need a clear method for tracking the source of any data used in model training.

## Considerations:

### IBM Granite Model:
#### Reasoning for Choosing IBM Granite:
Open-source Transparency: IBM Granite is an open-source model, meaning it’s fully auditable. This ensures that all the training data used is traceable, addressing potential concerns over copyright infringement. By choosing a model with transparent training data, you ensure that you're not unknowingly using proprietary data.

#### Avoid Copyright Issues: 
We are reducing the risk of copyright issues because the model's training data is public and traceable. It's important to understand exactly where the model’s data is coming from to ensure compliance.
Customizability: Open-source models like IBM Granite can be customized to fit your specific needs, allowing you to fine-tune the model to the domain you're working in (e.g., education or language learning).
Model Maintenance and Support: IBM Granite being open-source also means there’s a community of contributors, and you can seek support from the community or contribute yourself. However, you may want to consider the level of support available (documentation, forums, etc.) and any potential costs for commercial support.

### Additional Considerations:
Hardware Investment: Ensure the $10k-$15k hardware investment is aligned with the requirements for your LLM. For example:
GPUs: Powerful GPUs such as NVIDIA's A100 or V100 may be necessary for running large models.
CPUs & RAM: These need to be capable of handling large datasets, possibly in the terabyte range, while providing fast computation speeds.
Storage: Sufficient storage will be required for model weights, training data, and student interactions.
System Resilience: As the student base grows, having failover mechanisms, backup systems, and robust disaster recovery procedures will be key in ensuring system uptime and data integrity.

## Security Measures: 
We will need strong data encryption for student data, secure access to the system (authentication), and regular security audits to prevent breaches.

## User Experience: 
As the number of active students increases, maintaining an intuitive, user-friendly interface is essential for student engagement and retention. This could involve adding features like personalized dashboards or integrating automated support tools (e.g., chatbots, help centers).
