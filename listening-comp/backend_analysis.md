# Japanese Listening Comprehension App - Backend Implementation Analysis

Based on the current implementation, here are the components that still need to be developed to complete the backend functionality:

## 1. Vector Database Implementation

While `init_db.py` creates a table with `content_embedding` column, we're missing:

- **Embedding Generation**: Code to convert Japanese text to vector embeddings
- **Vector Search**: Implementation of similarity search functionality
- **Vector Storage**: Proper serialization/deserialization of embeddings to/from SQLite

Suggested files to create:
- `backend/vector_db.py` - For embedding and vector search operations
- `backend/embedding_service.py` - For generating embeddings specific to Japanese text

## 2. Database Operations

Current database is initialized but lacks:

- **CRUD Operations**: Functions to add/update/delete/retrieve transcripts and questions
- **Transaction Management**: Proper handling of database transactions
- **Persistence**: Code to ensure data is properly stored between sessions

Suggested files to create:
- `backend/db_operations.py` - For common database operations
- `backend/models.py` - For ORM-style model definitions

## 3. ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition)

The API mentions ASR in documentation but lacks implementation:

- **Speech Recognition Endpoint**: Handle audio uploads and process speech
- **Integration with OpenAI Whisper**: For Japanese speech recognition
- **Pronunciation Feedback**: Compare user pronunciation with expected patterns

Suggested files to create:
- `backend/speech_recognition.py` - For ASR implementation
- `backend/pronunciation_analysis.py` - For feedback on user's Japanese pronunciation

## 4. JLPT Level Classification

While question generation accepts JLPT levels as input, we need:

- **Automatic Level Detection**: Analyze text to determine appropriate JLPT level
- **Grammar Point Extraction**: Identify grammar structures by JLPT level
- **Vocabulary Tagging**: Tag words according to JLPT levels

Suggested files to create:
- `backend/jlpt_classifier.py` - For analyzing and classifying Japanese content by JLPT level

## 5. User Management and Progress Tracking

Currently missing:

- **User Authentication**: Login/registration system
- **Progress Tracking**: Store and retrieve user progress
- **Performance Analytics**: Track improvement over time

Suggested files to create:
- `backend/user_manager.py` - For user authentication and management
- `backend/progress_tracker.py` - For tracking learning progress

## 6. Enhanced TTS Features

Current TTS is basic and could be enhanced with:

- **Multiple Voice Providers**: Support for Amazon Polly, Google TTS
- **Pitch Accent Visualization**: Visual representation of Japanese pitch patterns
- **Speed Control**: Variable playback speeds for different learning levels

Suggested files to create:
- `backend/tts_service.py` - Enhanced version with multiple providers and options

## 7. API Enhancements

Current API needs:

- **CORS Support**: For frontend integration
- **Request Validation**: More robust validation of inputs
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent API abuse
- **Caching**: Cache responses for frequently accessed content

Suggested updates:
- Enhance `api.py` with these features or split into multiple files

## 8. Testing Infrastructure

Missing:

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions
- **Integration Tests**: Test API endpoints
- **Test Data**: Sample Japanese content for testing

Suggested files to create:
- `backend/tests/` directory with various test files

## 9. Modularization

Current implementation has minimal separation of concerns:

- **Service Layer**: Separate business logic from API endpoints
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstract database operations
- **Configuration Management**: Better handling of environment variables and settings

## 10. Japanese-Specific Features

Missing specialized Japanese language features:

- **Furigana Support**: Add readings above kanji
- **Pitch Accent Marking**: Indicate pitch patterns
- **Kanji/Kana Conversion**: Convert between different Japanese writing systems

Suggested files to create:
- `backend/japanese_text_utils.py` - For Japanese-specific text processing

## Implementation Priority Order

1. Complete basic Vector Database functionality
2. Add Database CRUD operations
3. Enhance API with validation and CORS
4. Implement ASR endpoint
5. Add Japanese-specific text utilities
6. Enhance TTS with more options
7. Add JLPT classification
8. Implement user management and progress tracking
9. Add testing infrastructure
10. Refactor for better modularization
