# Frontend Technical Specifications

## Overview
This document outlines the technical specifications for the frontend of the application, which will be built using Next.js 14 with Server Components. The frontend will interact with the backend (Postgres + TypeScript) and implement all necessary UI and screens following a clean architecture approach.

## Technologies
- **Next.js 14**: A React framework for building server-side rendered and static web applications.
- **Server Components**: For improved performance and user experience.
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience.
- **CSS Modules / Styled Components**: For styling the application.
- **React Query / SWR**: For data fetching and caching.
- **Jest / React Testing Library**: For unit and integration testing.

## Project Structure
The project will follow a clean architecture approach, separating concerns into different layers:

- **Pages**: Contains the Next.js pages.
- **Components**: Reusable UI components.
- **Layouts**: Layout components that wrap pages.
- **Services**: API calls and business logic.
- **Hooks**: Custom React hooks.
- **Styles**: CSS modules or styled components.
- **Utils**: Utility functions and helpers.
- **Tests**: Unit and integration tests.

## Setup and Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Run the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## Directory Structure
```
/src
  /components
  /hooks
  /layouts
  /pages
  /services
  /styles
  /utils
  /tests
```

## Pages and Routing
- **Home Page**: `/`
- **Login Page**: `/login`
- **Dashboard**: `/dashboard`
- **Profile**: `/profile`
- **Settings**: `/settings`

## API Integration
- Use `fetch` or `axios` for API calls.
- Create a service layer to handle API interactions.
- Use React Query or SWR for data fetching and caching.

## State Management
- Use React's built-in state management for local state.
- Use Context API or Zustand for global state management.

## Styling
- Use CSS Modules or Styled Components for styling.
- Follow a consistent naming convention and structure for styles.

## Testing
- Use Jest and React Testing Library for unit and integration tests.
- Write tests for components, hooks, and services.

## Deployment
- Use Vercel for deploying the Next.js application.
- Configure CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments.

## Best Practices
- Follow the principles of clean architecture.
- Write modular and reusable code.
- Ensure type safety with TypeScript.
- Write comprehensive tests.
- Maintain a consistent code style and structure.

## Conclusion
This document provides a comprehensive guide for setting up and developing the frontend of the application using Next.js 14 with Server Components. Following these specifications will ensure a scalable, maintainable, and high-performance frontend.
